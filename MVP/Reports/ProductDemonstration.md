# Product Demonstration Report

## Introduction
The solution our team is presenting will be a Web Application implemented using Python Flask. We have created a minimum viable product with some of the base features implemented for a working Student Attendance Managment System.

In this report we will be demonstrating the following features:
- Login system
- Dashboard
    - User
    - Admin
- Partial attendance system

## Demo
When visiting the web application, the following window is shown and it prompts you to login to your account.

Clicking the 'log in', you will be taken to another page to enter your credentials.

Logging in as a student moves you to your student dashboard. Here you will see the next class that you can attend.
