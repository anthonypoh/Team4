* *Give details of whether this story has been assigned to someone yet, and whether it is completed yet.*

Anthony, our Scrum Master will be in charged of User Story 1, which is to create a flask server, user and class database and MVP UI. We are currently working on User Story 2. Ruiqi will be doing the user interface while Danny and Jun Yong will assist in project backlog and implementing other added user features for the Final Product.
The other users stories will be assigned in our upcoming scrum meetings, at the moment we are working on our MVP.

* *Include a screenshots of any relevant attachments.*

*In addition to user stories (which is the main thing we are trying to teach for agile), try to include one or two other requirement modelling techniques, e.g. as listed in the lecture.*
We are using class based modelling which identifies classes, attributes and relationships used by the system when pulling data. For example, when the student enters his module ID, the system
will show them their attendance for the related model as the attribute "Module" has been classed into our code database.

We are also using data driven modelling which is quantitative data analysis methods to identify and process user data. For example, the system will remember the lecturer's or student's favourite settings
without them having to set it up everytime they login to our webapp. 

*Try to group the requirements under two sub-headings: functional requirements, and non-functional requirements.*

Functional Requirements:
User can reset password via email if forgot password
User can register an account
User can capture Attendance
User can apply leave
User can set alarms
Display timetable and classroom location info
Facial recognition to confirm attendance

Non-functional requirements:
Home page
Input button
Calender feature
View attendance summary
Download and import attendance records
Notifications
Detect percentage of attendance

*When marking this section we will be looking to see your team has understood the correct way to represent User-Stories and one or more other requirement modelling methods, and the requirements listed are giving as much relevant information for the development team as possible.*

## Risk Log

*In this section list the risks you have identified for your project.  For each Risk identified:*

First we will look at the process risks involved, whereby our team do not understand the needs of our users (customers) and we planned a product that is too complicated for them to use.
Hence, Jun Yong will be going over the functional and non-functional requirements and try his best to simplify the software. Danny, our product owner will also discuss with our users,
to gauge their reactions to our software and update their needs to the development team timely.

Another process risk is ineffective testing where our team missed serious defects or problems with our products, this is why Anthony, our scrum master will be in charge of testing the product
based on the AGILE testing model. He is in charge of the testing phase because he has vast knowledge in software engineering. We will then have a second round of test done by Ruiqi and the last
round of testing done by Danny, our product owner - this process will be carried out in accordance with our KanBan Board schedule. If possible, we would like to bring in real students and lecturers
to BETA test the system before the launch so we can effectively mitigate this risk and ensure that our testing is most effective.

Next, let us look at product risk, which is related to our SAMS system. One of the biggest risk would be poorly defined interfaces in our SAMS systems - for example upon login, the roles of the student,
leturers and admins are not properly defined and it leads to confusion or even error in logging attendance. This is why we hold weekly scrum meetings where Anthony will go over our product interfaces and
test our codes to make sure that all functions and databases are correctly defined. Our product owner, Danny will also work with Jun Yong and Ruiqi to ensure the expectations of our users are correctly conveyed.

Next would be inexperienced personnel which is not capable of doing a certain task or did not complete the task as expected due to inexperience - this is actually a common issue where team members over promise and
cannot deliver. This is why we conduct weekly scrum meetings and Anthony(scrum master) will check on our progresses and reassign tasks if a certain team is underperforming. Ruiqi will also hold a weekly counselling session
for members who needs help with their task. Our scrum master is very approachable for any team members that needed help with their tasks. - he is willing to offer advise and help when we needed it.

We are using the AGILE method to manage risks and it is being tracked and updated in real time. The four step risks control method are: Identifying Risks, Making an Assement, considering responses and Analyzing reviews, where
we apply to our projects and this helps us to mitigate risks effectivley. 

* *Include a URL link to the Jira risk issue.* 
* *Paste in the Risk's Description and Summary from Jira.  Also state the Impact and Likilihood.*
* *Give details of whether this story has been assigned to someone yet, and whether it is completed yet.*
* *Include, from the Jira description / comments, details of what mitigating actions are being taking and by whom.*

*When marking this section we will be looking to see several realistic risks have been noted, and are actively being tracked and mitigated against.*
