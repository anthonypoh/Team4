# Team Four Effort Log

An effort log is a record of the time, activities, and tasks performed by team members in a software development project. It helps to keep track of the team's progress, identify areas of improvement, and allocate resources more effectively. The Team Four Effort Log was created during five sprints of the project and was submitted in Markdown format, which is a lightweight markup language for writing documents. The team used this log to track their progress towards creating the MVP (Minimum Viable Product), a basic version of the software with enough features to satisfy early adopters.
