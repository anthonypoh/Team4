# Project Management Log

## Project management discussion

Our team has worked effectively together and demonstrated strong collaboration skills. Each team member has shown responsibility with their respective task and has been proactive in communicating any issues or problems to the team. This has resulted in a smooth and dynamic workflow and efficient problem-solving.

The project is moving along smoothly, and we are on track to meet our deadlines. We have been able to recognize any potential difficulties and take immediate action to address them because of our regular check-ins and progress updates. Our careful and thorough planning and project management techniques have been essential to the project's success thus far.
Overall, we are confident in our ability to achieve a high-quality final product. 

*Discuss the scrum meetings, and what could make them more efficient (if anything).*

Scrum meetings are essential because they provide a platform for regular communication between team members, facilitate decision-making, identify and resolve issues, and ensure that the project is moving forward efficiently.

To make scrum meetings even more efficient, have a clear agenda, use visual aids, follow up on action items, and review meeting minutes. These strategies will ensure productive discussions and progress on the project.

*Highlight any communication issues that might be affecting the project.*

A communication issue that might be affecting the project are due to full time work and other study modules is limited availability. When team members are stretched thin, they may not have the time to attend meetings or respond to emails and messages in a timely manner, leading to delays and miscommunication. This can impact the project timeline and result in missed deadlines, making it important for team members to prioritize and manage their time effectively.

*If standup meetings were used, then include a Jira link, and discuss their effectiveness.*

## Sprint Burndown Charts

*In this section include a screenshot of a sprint-burndown chart for each of your completed sprints.*

*For each sprint, include links to the standup meetings (recorded on Jira, hopefully) associated with each sprint.*

## Burndown-Charts Discussion
*Add a discussion of what the burndown charts indicate, and how your team might improve their velocity / estimation ability in future sprints.*

## Product Backlog
*Include here a screenshot of your current product backlog.*

## Other Areas
*If your team has anything else they want to demonstrate, e.g. advanced project management tools, reporting graphs with suitable explanation and interpretation, advanced use of Jira (e.g. issue links, epics, versions), or continuous integration tools, then include a summary here.*
