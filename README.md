Working on dev branch for now.
We will be using Python 3.10

Make sure you are in your Python environment with pip installed then proceed with the installation.

# Installation
`pip install -e .`

This command will install the required libraries.

# Running a local server
`flask --app flaskr --debug run`

Flask will deploy on your localhost in development mode. Happy coding! :)
